Set it up using docker compose
------

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have already installed both Docker Engine and Docker Compose. You don’t need to install Python or Mongo,
 as both are provided by Docker images.
 
[Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

[Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Build and run your app with Compose

From your project directory, start up your application by running `docker-compose up`

    $ docker-compose up
    Creating flaskproject_postgresdb_1 ... done
    Creating flaskproject_frontend_1   ... done
    Creating flask                     ... done
    Creating webserver                 ... done

Next go to http://localhost/api/docs and API docs should be visible
As well as if you go to the http://localhost the frontend app should be visible 

Set it up using pure python and react
------
Create a .env file copying the .env.example file and modifying values. (If we are 
running the frontend and backend separately these files should be 
copied and modified in both directories, meaningfully frontend and backend)

    $ cp .env.example .env

Create a virtual environment and install the requirements

    $ python3 -m venv ./venv
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


Start the development server

    $ python run.py
    * Serving Flask app "wsgi.py"
    * Environment: production
    WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
    Use a production WSGI server instead.
    * Debug mode: off
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
